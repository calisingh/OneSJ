        <h4>Who we are?</h4>
        <p>
          We are a volunteer-driven, open-source project to help youth
          communities access information and resources on mental health. We
          currently feature resources focus on youth and young adult mental
          health but we plan to expand to food assistance, shelters, clothing,
          and financial help. You can find more information on the project,
          including the source code for replicating OneSJ on our Github page. We
          are affiliated with Mayor Sam Liccardo’s Office of Technology and
          Innovation (MOTI), which leverages technology to improve our
          residents’ livelihoods and opportunities with an emphasis on
          inclusion, equity, and antifragility.{" "}
        </p>
        <p>
          We’ve grown with the support of Mayor Sam Liccardo’s Digital Action
          Corps, an initiative which enables homegrown innovation talent to
          solve city problems.{" "}

        <h4>About the product.</h4>
        <p>
          OneSJ is a web-application for potentially the 1 million residents of
          San Jose, some of whom may have exacerbated inequities around internet
          quality and device access; focused around the youth, it has the
          potential to become a powerhouse in which the youth of the Bay Area
          can use to their advantage and get help when they need it.
        </p>

        <h4>Thanks!</h4>
        <p>
          Special thanks to CARTO for powering our site, Mayor Sam Liccardo for
          bringing us together through the Digital Action Corps,
