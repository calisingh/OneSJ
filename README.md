# OneSJ
One SJ is a web app that points youth/young adults in San Jos√© to relevant mental health support options based on a needs-based filter. Eventually, we plan to expand with other categories of services like nutrition or financial support; utilizing the React JavaScript library framework, Spring framework &amp; inversion of control container for the Java platform, MongoDB, Docker, GitHub, and CartoDB based GIS.
