OneSJ is a web app that points youth/young adults in San José to relevant mental health support options. On our web application, we provide information on mental and physical health resources in and around the Bay Area, which is updated every month. Eventually, we plan to expand with other categories of services, such as nutrition or financial support. Other categories are in-progress! 

We are working with our partners to bring together the best available and up-to-date information in an easy-to-use interface method. 

We are a volunteer-driven, open-source project to help youth communities navigate the COVID crisis by providing information and resources on mental and physical health. We currently impart 300+ resources revolving around youth health but plan to expand our services to providing means on food assistance, shelters, clothing, and medicine. 

You can find more information on the project, including the source code for replicating the project, from our Github page.

We are affiliated with ‘The Mayor’s Office of Technology and Innovation (MOTI)’, leveraging technology to address pressing issues facing our city to improve our residents’ livelihoods, opportunities, and city experience with an emphasis on inclusion, equity, and antifragility. 

Special thanks to CARTO for powering our site.

# OneSJ
OneSJ is a web app that points youth/young adults in San José to relevant mental health support options. Eventually, we plan to expand with other categories of services like nutrition or financial support; utilizing the React JavaScript library framework, Spring framework &amp; inversion of control container for the Java platform, MongoDB, Docker, GitHub, and CartoDB based GIS. 

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `yarn eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
