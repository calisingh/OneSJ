# Who we are?
We are a volunteer-driven, open-source project to help youth communities access information and resources on mental health. We currently feature resources focused on youth and young adult mental health, but we plan to expand to  food assistance, shelters, clothing, and financial help. You can find more information on the project, including the source code for replicating OneSJ, on our Github page. 

We’ve grown with the support of Mayor Sam Liccardo’s Digital Action Corps, an initiative which enables homegrown innovation talent to solve city problems. 

## About the product.
OneSJ is a web-application for potentially the 1 million residents of San Jose, some of whom may have exacerbated inequities around internet quality and device access; focused around the youth, it has the potential to become a powerhouse in which the youth of the Bay Area can use to their advantage and get help when they need it.

## Thanks
Special thanks to CARTO for powering our site, Mayor Sam Liccardo for bringing us together through the Digital Action Corps, BayAreaCommunity.org and unBox for providing us access to services data and your engineering/design feedback, Code for San José for your insights on designing for accessibility, and Google.org, SAP, and PayPal for providing mentorship and helpful feedback, and the community members who shared their pain points with us and tested the product.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `yarn eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.

## Learn More
